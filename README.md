### Predict survival on the Titanic
Complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.<br>
In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

#### Data Dictionary
<li>Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes</li>
<li>pclass: Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</li>
<li>sibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</li>
<li>parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic</li>
<li>ticket: Ticket number</li>
<li>cabin: Cabin number</li>
<li>embarked: Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</li>

#### 4. Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data
to create features (feature vectors) that make machine learning algorithms work.<br>
Feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object.
Many algorithms in machine learning require a numerical representation of object
